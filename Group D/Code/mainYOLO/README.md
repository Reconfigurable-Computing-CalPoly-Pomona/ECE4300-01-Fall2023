This is the code for the mainYOLO project. This Visual Studio project activates the webcam and object detection using YOLOv8's selection of models.

The v8 models must be placed in a subfolder named 'modelsYOLOv8' on the same level as the mainYOLO.py file.

The YOLOv8 models are too big to add to this repository. Therefore, you can download them using these links:
